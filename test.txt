This is a test repository to simulate the transfer of GitHub repository from a personal account to an organization.

Here are the steps that I have tested:
 1. created and initialized local repository on Poseidon
 2. added this file and committed a few changes
 3. created GitHub repository on personal account
 4. pushed local repository to personal account
