This is a test repository to simulate the transfer of GitHub repository from a personal account to an organization.

Here are the steps that I have tested:
 1. created and initialized local repository on Poseidon
 2. added this file and committed a few changes
 3. created GitHub repository on personal account
 4. pushed local repository to personal account
 5. transferred repository from personal account to SCOAR-WHOI organization
 6. updated URL of local repository on Poseidon: git remote set-url origin git@github.com:SCOAR-WHOI/test_repo.git
 7. git pull on local repository on Poseidon gives: "Already up to date."
 8. commit latest steps of test procedure and push to GitHub
 9. forked test_repo from SCOAR-WHOI to personal account
10. cloned fork as local copy on Poseidon
11. Modify this file on original test_repo that is linked to SCOAR-WHOI
12. commit newest changes and push to SCOAR-WHOI/test_repo on GitHub
13. sync fork in personal account and pull changes to local copy of fork on Poseidon
14. This line is added in the local copy of the fork on Poseidon
15. commit and push latest changes to fork in personal account
16. create and merge pull request to add changes in personal fork to SCOAR-WHOI
17. pull latest changes to local copy of test_repo from SCOAR-WHOI on Poseidon
18. sync fork in personal account and pull changes of fork
19. commit and push latest changes from local copy on Poseidon to SCOAR-WHOI
