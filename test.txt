This is a test repository to simulate the transfer of GitHub repository from a personal account to an organization.

Here are the steps that I have tested:
 1. created and initialized local repository on Poseidon
 2. added this file and committed a few changes
 3. created GitHub repository on personal account
 4. pushed local repository to personal account
 5. transferred repository from personal account to SCOAR-WHOI organization
 6. updated URL of local repository on Poseidon: git remote set-url origin git@github.com:SCOAR-WHOI/test_repo.git
 7. git pull on local repository on Poseidon gives: "Already up to date."
 8. commit latest steps of test procedure and push to GitHub
